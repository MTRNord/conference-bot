    #  person_id        - TEXT(like) - The penta ID for the person.
    #  event_role       - TEXT(like) - One of [speaker, coordinator, host]. See roles later on.
    #  name             - TEXT(like) - The full name, or otherwise useful name, for the person.
    #  email            - TEXT(like) - The preferred email address for the person.
    #  matrix_id        - TEXT(like) - If known, the Matrix User ID for the person, otherwise null.
    #  conference_room  - TEXT(like) - The relevant room. This should match the event_id or be
    #                                  the room where coordinators are assigned.
    #
    # People may be assigned multiple roles with multiple rows.
    #
    # Roles:
    #  speaker      - A speaker for event_id. This person will get moderator in their talk's

    #                 to check in before their talk starts.
    #
    #  host         - Someone who is moderating the talk itself in collaboration with the speakers
    #                 for the event_id. One host must check in before the talk starts, otherwise
    #                 the issue will be raised to the management room and coordinators will be
    #                 asked to take over. Hosts will get moderator in their talk's room, and be
    #                 invited to the public auditorium room, backstage room, and talk room.
    #
    #  coordinator  - These are typically people responsible for scheduling the auditorium's
    #                 talks. They'll get moderator in the auditorium room, backstage room, and all
    #                 talk rooms for their auditorium, though will only be invited to the auditorium
    #                 and backstage room (and the talk rooms on-demand if needed to fill in for a
    #                 missing host).
